#### 个人介绍
- Hi

#### 项目介绍
- I'm from Department of Enterprise Digitalization,
- One of the most recent projects I've been working on is an intelligent digital assistant which is used internally by the company. Let's call it XiaoI.
- The goal of this project is to help our employees can access internal knowledge base and self services more conveniently and efficiently, users can interact with XiaoI by normal language.

- Technically, the system is built using Spring AI framework, with Kafka and Redis for messaging and caching, MySQL for persistence.
- To cater for the complex scenarios, We set up multiple agents and orchestra them into different workflow, each agent is doing its own job, for example intent classify, query rewrite, task execution, which made the system much more flexible.

- As for me, in this project I worked as the Tech Lead. I was responsible for overall technical design and implementations of key modules.
- Besides that, I also worked closely with product managers and other team members to make sure the technical solution matches the business requirements.
